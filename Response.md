*What I've Learned*

This starter course was a refresher on Github for me. I have experience using it in other 
courses as well as during my internships. It was helpful to relearn the basics, such as 
the difference between a fork and clone, push and pull protocols, etc.

*What I'm Still Confused About*

I'm not really confused about any of the Github material, but some of the instructions
regarding how to submit homework through Github is unclear. The Github Classroom link
seems be problematic for many students and I've spoken to a few who still don't 
understand how to turn in assignments.
